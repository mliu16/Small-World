## Synopsis

### Small-World
The mathematical model that we use for studying the nature of pairwise connections among entities is known as the Graph. Graphs are important for studying the natural world and for helping us to better understand and refine the networks that we create. From models of the nervous system in neurobiology, to the study of the spread of infectious diseases in medical sicence, to the development of the telephone system, graphs have played a critical role in science and engineering over the past century, including the development of the internet itself.
Some graphs exhibit a specific property known as the small-world phenomenon. You may be familiar with this property, which is sometimes known as six degrees of separation. It is the basic idea that, even though each of us has relatively few acquaintances, there is a relatively short chain of acquaintances (the six degrees of separation) separating us from one another. This hypothesis was validated experimentally by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s and modelled mathematically by Duncan Watts and Stephen Strogatz in the 1990s. In recent years, the principle has proven important in a remarkable variety of applications. Scientists are interested in small-world graphs because they model natural phenomena, and engineers are interested in building networks that take advantage of the natural properties of small-world graphs.

### Graph
A graph is comprised of a set of vertices and a set of edges. Each edge represents a connection between two vertices. Two vertices are neighbors if they are connected by an edge, and the degree of a vertex is its number of neighbors. We often visualize graphs by drawing labelled geometric shapes (vertices) connected by lines (edges), but it is always important to remember that it is the connections that are essential, not the way we depict them.
Diverse range of system where graphs are appropriate starting points for understanding structure: Human biology, Social network, Physical systems, Transportation systems, Communications systems, Resource distribution, Mechanical systems, Software systems, Financial systems.

### ST (Symbol Table)
A symbol table is a data type used to associate values with keys. In the other words, symbol table is a collection of key-value pairs. Sorted symbol table implementation using a java.util.TreeMap. It does not allow duplicates.

### SET (Set Data Type)
A set is a collection of distinct keys, like a symbol table with no values. Set implementation using Javaâ€™s TreeSet library. It does not allow duplicates.
